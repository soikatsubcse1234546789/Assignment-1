            <p>Cricket is the most popular sport in Bangladesh. There is a strong domestic league which on many occasions also saw Test players from many countries (Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, and England) gracing the cricket fields of Bangladesh. In the year 2000 Bangladesh became a full member of the International Cricket Council, which allows the national team to play Test cricket. The Bangladesh national cricket team goes by the nickname of the Tigers â€“ after the Royal Bengal Tiger. At present among the most popular cricket players in Bangladesh are Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah Riyad, Mustafizur Rahman and Mashrafe Bin Mortaza. Becoming champion in the 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup is the country's biggest cricketing achievement.</p><br>
